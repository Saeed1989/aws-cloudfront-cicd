o successfully use the AWS CLI in a CI/CD pipeline, you need to ensure that the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are set correctly and securely. Here's a breakdown of how to handle this setup, along with the corrected and complete configuration process:

1. Set Region
Add a valid AWS region (e.g., us-east-1) in the aws configure set region step:

bash
Copy code
aws configure set region us-east-1
2. Environment Variables in GitHub Actions
In a GitHub Actions workflow, you can securely pass the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY using GitHub Secrets:

Example yaml:
yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Configure AWS Credentials
      run: |
        aws configure set aws_access_key_id $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        aws configure set region $AWS_REGION
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

    - name: Deploy to S3
      run: |
        aws s3 sync ./build s3://your-s3-bucket-name --delete
3. How to Add AWS Secrets in GitHub
Access Repository Settings:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
Add Secrets:

Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_REGION as secrets.
Use Secrets in Workflow:

Reference them in your workflow file using ${{ secrets.<SECRET_NAME> }}.
4. Test the Configuration
Run your workflow to ensure the AWS CLI can authenticate and execute the desired commands. If the workflow fails, review the logs to identify misconfigurations or missing permissions.

fatal error: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: User: arn:aws:iam::798481393332:user/Bucket-upload is not authorized to perform: s3:ListBucket on resource: "arn:aws:s3:::***" because no identity-based policy allows the s3:ListBucket action

This error occurs because the IAM user associated with your credentials does not have sufficient permissions to perform the s3:ListBucket action on the specified S3 bucket. To resolve this issue, you need to update the IAM policy for the user or role with the necessary permissions.

Steps to Fix:
Identify the IAM User/Role:

Verify which IAM user (Bucket-upload) or role is being used in your GitHub workflow.
Update the Policy:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to IAM > Users > Select the user (Bucket-upload).
Edit the Policy:

Attach or update the policy to include permissions for s3:ListBucket and other required actions.
Example IAM Policy:
json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
Replace your-bucket-name with the name of your bucket.
The first Statement allows listing objects in the bucket.
The second Statement allows reading, writing, and deleting objects in the bucket.
Attach the Policy:
Save the updated policy and attach it to the Bucket-upload IAM user.
